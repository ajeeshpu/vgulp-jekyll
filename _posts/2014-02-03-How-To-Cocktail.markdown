title:  "How to Cocktail- Black Russian, White Russian, AK- 47"
description: "The Black and the White Russians are easy to drink cocktails, yet they pack quite a punch. The White Russian especially, is commonly known as a drink for the rubes( an unsophisticated person from a rural area) and the well seasoned guzzlers alike. The Black Russian was created during the Cold War in Brussels and named after the spirit Vodka (primarily a Russian export) and black (coffee liqueur). Meanwhile the White Russian gained popularity when "dude" the protagonist from a 1998 comedy movie "The big Lebowski", gulped down eight of those and dropped the ninth one. (see what I mean?). "

  The Black and the White Russians are easy to drink cocktails, yet they pack quite a punch. The White Russian especially, is commonly known as a drink for the rubes( an unsophisticated person from a rural area) and the well seasoned guzzlers alike. The Black Russian was created during the Cold War in Brussels and named after the spirit Vodka (primarily a Russian export) and black (coffee liqueur). Meanwhile the White Russian gained popularity when "dude" the protagonist from a 1998 comedy movie "The big Lebowski", gulped down eight of those and dropped the ninth one. (see what I mean?). 

Okay! so, Here is the recipe..

***Black Russian***

* Vodka- 45 ml
* Kahlua- 20 ml ( coffee liqueur)
In a rock's glass filled with ice, add vodka and kahlua and serve with a straw.

Now, the Black Russian becomes a White Russian with the addition of cream.

* Kahlua- 20 ml
* Dairy cream
In a shaker filled with ice add vodka, kahlua and cream and shake for 20 seconds. Transfer the contents into a tall glass and enjoy! 

***AK- 47***

Ak 47 cocktail, just like the 'assault rifle', hits you straight in the head because of all the alcohol in it. A friend of mine once commented that it smelt like nail polish. According to her, it lacked flavor (yes, her go to drinks are breezers!). Now folks! put your guard down and I bet you would definitely have a different opinion altogether. So here is the recipe..

* Gin- 20 ml
* Rum- 20 ml
* Whiskey- 20 ml
* Brandy- 20 ml
* Bourbon Whiskey- 20 ml
* Cointreau/ Triple sec (orange liqueur) 20 ml
* Soda water
* Lime (fresh) 
In a tall glass ( a really tall glass, about 450 ml) filled with ice, add the ingredients and squeeze about 15 ml lime juice. Top it with soda water, savour the cocktail and hold on to your chair! 

***Here is to a happy gulping!***
