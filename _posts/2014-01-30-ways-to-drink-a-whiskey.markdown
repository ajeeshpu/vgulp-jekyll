Despite whiskey’s deservedly lofty associations, it is indeed a drink for the every man. If someone tells you to drink your whiskey a certain way only, ask them to mind their own business as it is your whiskey and you can drink it the way you want. Everything said, here are a few ways that I prefer

First things first!

I choose what to drink. I love my **Bourbons and single malt Scotches**.

Proper **glassware**.

I typically use a snifter (glass with a broader base that tapers towards the end, like a tulip flower) or a rocks glass (tumbler).

Snifters ;)

* **Whiskey neat**
Tasting the whiskey at room temperature, with nothing added to it. Whiskey tastes intense and I do it when I know I can work from home the following day.  Smell, sip, savor, sleep is my mantra.

* **Whiskey on the rocks**
Taste it chilled. Whiskey flavors tastes different when consumed chilled instead of at room temperature.

* **Whiskey with water**.
Adding a few drops of water to the whiskey releases the aromas and flavors. If my tongue pallets are asking for a manageable drink that is not too intense, then I tend to get generous with my water pour.

* **Whiskey with a mixer**.
Whiskey with soda or a whiskey cocktail. Whiskey sours are easy to make and i don’t remember the last time when i stopped after just one. I add sugar and lime juice to 60 ml of whiskey on the rocks and the night has only begun!

**Here is to a happy gulping folks!**
