***Can alcohol make you fat?***
Our bodies need a definite number of calories to maintain our weight based on our height, age, gender and activity level. We gain weight when we exceed our daily need of calories. Alcohol can lead to a considerable amount of weight gain from the empty calories it provides and also by causing us to feel hungry. Studies show that alcohol increases our appetite by suppressing leptin (hormone which tells our brain to stop eating) so we end up over eating typically after an evening of binge drinking!

***Make you feel warmer on a cold night?***
Turns out, just one alcoholic drink could make you feel warmer, but it actually lowers your core body temperature.
How does alcohol employ this rule of opposites? Alcohol may make your skin feel warm, but this apparent heat wave is deceptive. A nip or two actually causes your blood vessels to dilate, moving warm blood closer to the surface of your skin, making you feel warmer temporarily. At the same time, however, those same veins pumping blood closer to the skin's surface cause you to lose core body heat - the heat you need to survive, especially if you're stuck in a snowdrift . This effect could lead to fatal hypothermia.
So a snifter of brandy may make you feel hot, but you certainly won't be that way for long!!

***Make you look older?***
Alcohol dehydrates our body, skin- our body's largest organ. Drinking alcohol deprives our skin of it's vital nutrients and vitamins. So, the truth is that yes, it can make us age faster by causing our skin to lose collagen and elasticity giving way to the appearance of wrinkles. However! it's the amount and frequency is what matters the most.


***Make you last longer in bed?*** ( not what you are thinking!)
Alcohol sure helps us to nod off but certainly interferes with the quality of sleep.
Too much booze interrupts the REM (rapid eye movement, or the dream phase)
cycle which is vital for memory and concentration. So the chances are, you if you've been drinking too much, you might end up waking up several times either to head to the bathroom or because you were having a nightmare!

***Makes you have a good time?***
You are an awesome gulper and You know it!
