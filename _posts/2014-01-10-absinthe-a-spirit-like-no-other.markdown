 Each year I make a list of new things i want to try. Some are scary and difficult, some are shockingly boring! I confess, I tried absinthe the first time with a friend last year as it was on my list,  just because of all the myths surrounding it. I enjoyed the taste, so I wanted to know more about this liquor and discovered a culture behind it.

Origin- Canton of Neuchatel, Switzerland
Alcohol content- 45 to 74 percentage. (90- 148 proof)
Color- bright green
Taste- licorice, like of anise ( if you’ve tried Sambuca)


  Absinthe also known as ***’le fee vert’***, or ‘the green fairy’ was formerly banned in many countries because of it’s hallucinogenic reputation. It has a chemical compound called thujone that supposedly gives the stuff it’s mind- bending edge. By international standards, any alcoholic beverage that contains more than 25 percentage alcohol by volume should not exceed more then 10 mg/kg thujone, while different brands of absinthe will contain anywhere from negligible amount to 35 mg/kg thujone. 

  I was certainly excited to watch my bartender as he started to pour me my first try of absinthe. So this is what he used and you will mostly need if you can get your hands on it..

* Absinthe- 30 ml
* A flat, perforated absinthe spoon 
* a cube of sugar
* ice cold water.
  Now the best part is the preparation of the drink! Absinthe can be used in many mixed drinks from contemporary and 19th century recipes and like any great spirit there are quite a few rituals surrounding it.

  ***Here is one way of making it.***

  Pour the absinthe into a glass. Lay absinthe spoon across the rim of the glass and place a single cube of sugar on the perforated area of the spoon. Drip ice cold water into the absinthe from a small pitcher over the the sugar cube enabling it to slowly dissolve into the absinthe. Stir the drink with the absinthe spoon. Drink it and wait until you can see fairies! 

  Yes! absinthe has a high alcoholic content so you don’t do shots! It certainly makes for a refreshing drink. One or two and there is no way you will cut your ears off. But these things go down easy and if you over do it, all bets are off! 

  I for one, didn’t see any angels or demons. I was glad that i somehow got a taste of it. Reach me at simi@vgulp.com  and let me know If you’ve tried absinthe before and have any crazy stories that you would like to share. 

Here is to happy gulping!
