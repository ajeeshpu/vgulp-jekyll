There are several stories but we like this one:
(Source: www.sexonthebeach.com)

The earliest known invention of the cocktail and name dates back to 1987 in Florida, USA. A distributor had just begun to sell a new product, peach schnapps, in the autumn.
 
With many tourists due for the spring holiday the distributor devised a contest that would pay the bar that sold the most peach schnapps a bonus of $1000 and the bartender that was responsible at that bar for the highest sales would receive $100.
 
A young bartender named Ted, working at Confetti's Bar, mixed up a peach schnapps, vodka, orange juice and grenadine cocktail. When Ted began to sell the drink, he was asked what it was called.
 
On the spot, Ted thought what the main reason was that people came to Florida for their Spring break – it was ***The Beach and Sex.***
"Sex on the Beach!" he replied, and as the drink gained fame that spring, thousands of students returned home and asked their local bartenders for ‘Sex on the Beach.’
 
The bartenders did not know how to make a drink they had never heard of so they asked around and this led to the many regional variations of the drink.

***To make the drink, you will need,***

* Vodka 45 ml
* Peach schnapps (peach liqueur) 45 ml
* Orange juice 60 ml
* Cranberry juice 60 ml
* Cherry and an orange slice for garnishing.

Fill a tall glass with ice. Add vodka, peach schnapps and the fruit juices. Garnish with cherry and an orange slice. Stir before sipping. Enjoy!

***Here is to a happy gulping!***
