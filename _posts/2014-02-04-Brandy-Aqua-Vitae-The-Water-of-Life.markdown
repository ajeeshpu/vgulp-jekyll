Feeling under the weather? Brandy is the ultimate sought after beverage to beat the chills! When I mention brandy, you probably get an an image of an older Gentleman, resting in his leather arm chair with a brandy snifter and perhaps smoking a pipe ( I get this visualization from older movies!). We think of brandies as an Old World's after dinner drink which is definite but also what I'm trying to emphasize here is that brandies are still around and are gaining popularity among the younger generation. Brandy, is a complex topic! One post on it will not be sufficient. But I'm going to try to cover as much as information I can conjure up.

## Brandy

 The term "Brandy " is derived from Dutch brandewijn, meaning "burnt wine". is distilled in most countries that produce wine. Brandy production dates back to the 12th century. 

### Types of Brandy

* **Cognac**
* **Armagnac**

  Cognac and Armagnac are regions in France. So a brandy can be a Cognac or an Armagnac depending on the region it is distilled in. 
The age of the brandy determines it's cost and class. Older the better and is of course, Pricier! 

* V.S. - very special,4 years.
* V.S.O.P.- very special old pale,4- 6 years.
* X.O.- extremely old,5.5- 40 years.

### How to drink brandy

  The classic way to enjoy a well aged brandy is in a snifter at room temperature (neat). Hold the base of the snifter in the palm to gently warm the drink to release the aromas. It is typically served this way as an after dinner drink, a digestif!
 When you see Pomace brandy on the label, it generally refers to the kind made from the seeds, stems and skins of the grapes used to make wine. Pomace brandies are typically served over ice and are used in cocktails.

The appreciation of Brandy is the combination of sight, scent and taste. Enjoy responsibly!
