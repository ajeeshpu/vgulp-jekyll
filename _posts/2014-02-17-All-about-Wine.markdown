We know we like wine and we love to drink it. But how do you decide what to pick when there are thousands of wine bottles on the shelf. It is like being a mouse getting lost in a maze. To simplify this task, here I give you a few basics to pick and appreciate a good wine. Your guide to elite showing off in corporate parties with the westerners starts here.

***So what the f**k is wine?***
Wine is fermented grape juice. When they are made from fruits, other than grapes like apples and berries they are called fruit wines. The term 'wine' can also refer to starch fermented (barley wine, sake) or fortified wines (Vermouth, typically used in cocktails). Now that you know what a wine is, let's get to step 2.

***Varietal- White and Red wines.***
Besides the color, the primary difference between the two is the parts of a grape that is used to make the wine. The juice of all grapes are clear to near clear. It can be straw or golden.The color of the end wine product does not come from the juice but the skin. So, a white wine can also be made from red grapes by using the pulp and eliminating the skin. Now, are you able to differentiate between a red / white?. If you want to get to the finer details, leave a comment below.

***What is the best wine?***
Personally, it is the one that tastes good to YOU for the least amount of money. That doesn't imply that you could charm the best of wine connoisseurs. But hey, the point is what makes you love it. 

***What are the four important factors that determine wine's character?***
* Varietal: Red wine or White wine.
* Soil
* Climate
* Winemaker's preference of aging/fermenting it: Steel fermenting or oak aged.
You are now closer to being a pro.

***Wine appreciation***
Wine appreciation is a matter of common sense. If it looks, smells and tastes good to you, then that's the one. Using all your senses is all that required to get better acquainted with the world of wines.

***Observe***- Specifically speaking about impressing the connoisseurs, you need to advance a level further. look for color and clarity. Hold the glass to a white background if possible in a well lit room. White wines vary from clear to golden and gain color as they age. Red wine ranges from purple to brick red and to brown as they get older. Pay attention folks, it gets complicated from hereon. 
***Swirl*** opens up aroma. exposing wine to air helps it "breathe".
***Smell*** for subtlety. Close your eyes and inhale through your nose. The first impression is always accurate. Common aromas include different fruits, herbs, spices, floral tones and vanilla.
***Taste***, the overall "taste" of a wine is a combination of smells and flavors.
(Different parts of your tongue are designed to taste different things: alcohol- back of your tongue, sweetness- tip, saltiness- center, sour- sides.)
Roll the wine across your taste buds and notice the flavors.
***Evaluate*** the wine. Is it fruity, dry, light or full bodied? Is the finish overly bitter or balanced, short or long? 
 European wines are classified based on the region where the grapes are grown like Bordeaux, Chianti, Champagne. Non- European wines are classified based on the kind of grapes used in the making like Melot, Cabernet Sauvignon.

Some popular whites and reds and here is how you pronounce them.

***White wines***
* Chardonnay pronounced Shar-doe-Nay
* Pinot Grigio-  Peen- Yo Gree Gio
* Sauvignon Blanc- Sow veen yohn- Blonk
* Gewurtztraminer- Ga vertz- trah Meener
* Riesling- Reez ling

***Red wines***
* Cabernet Sauvignon- Cah Bear nay So veen Yonh
* Merlot- Mare low
* Pinot Noir- Pee no Nwah
* Gamay Beaujolais- Ga may Bo sho Lay 
* Petite Syrah- Puh teet see rah.

***Is older the better?***
Theoretically, as a wine ages, it's flavors become more subtle. But there are limitations. ****Older is not always better.****First, age does not automatically make a wine better. A bad young wine will only grow up to be a bad old wine. Wine that ages well usually has to be made that way and be made from a certain variety that does age well, as not all wines do.(Source:winexmagazine) It also depends a lot on how the wine has been stored. It should be kept in a temperature controlled environment, stored on its side, if you plan on ever drinking it. Heat is a killer. You might one day pour some of your fine vintage to find out that vinegar would have tasted better. Most of the wine bottles you find in stores, would have a  good "drinking" date an X amount of years when the wine is at its peak. 

This topic is never ending. Leave your questions and comments and let's talk more about a fine glass of your preferred wine. Remember to enjoy responsibly.

***Here is to a happy gulping!***
