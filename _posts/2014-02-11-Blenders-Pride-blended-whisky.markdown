Whiskey is known as a gentleman's drink. This means, it is a drink for people who know when to stop drinking. When it comes to a good whiskey, I honestly feel that it is supposed to be sipped and enjoyed on an evening and let it relax you, instead of doing whiskey shots and passing out on your friend's couch! To all those who are on the same page as I am, let me proudly introduce you to the pride of it's maker's, "Blender's Pride" whiskey. It is a perfect blend of taste and class in a bottle!

***" Make the world a stylish place"*** 
 Blenders pride was manufactured in 1995 by Pernod Ricard. It is a blend of Indian grains and Scottish malts. Pernod Ricard launched a premium version in 2011 called the Blenders Pride Reserve Collection and at the time was one of the  most expensive locally made Indian Whiskey.

*Color- Golden, Amber.
* Alcohol content- 42.8 percentage
*Tasting notes- Light, fruity (peaches and cherries), smooth. Short with a grain influenced finish.

Blender's Pride is usually served with still water, sparkling water(soda) on the rocks or neat, straight from the bottle. The biggest plus point of this whiskey is the sheer joy it gives you right from the first sip. It's the only Indian blend, I find to be the closest to a traditional Scotch. So, all you Scotch snobs who think that Scotches are the only sip worthy drinks in the world of whiskey, here is blended whiskey you shouldn't miss. For the rest of the non scotch drinking world, first master the art of drinking, drink to feel elated. Try Blender's Pride, enjoy it and let people around you enjoy your company. 

***Here is to happy gulping!***
