Once upon a time in Mexico...someone invented the Margarita! Or did they? 
Well! there have been several claims as to its origins. But no one really knows who came up with this world famous drink. Margarita In its classic form- tequila, lime juice, triple sec, served in a glass with a salted rim is a perfect combination of sweet, salt, sour and bitter. Here is an easy recipe for the real deal.

***Rimming the glass with salt.***

In a cocktail shaker filled with ice, add tequila, triple sec (substitute 3/4th cup of orange juice instead, even though, I suggest on investing on a bottle of triple sec as it is a staple in a lot of cocktails ), lime juice, and sugar. Shake for 30 seconds. Wet the rim of the glass with water or a lime wedge and dip the rim into a plate with salt. Transfer the contents into the salt rimmed glass, garnish with lime and enjoy!

***Here is to a happy gulping!***
