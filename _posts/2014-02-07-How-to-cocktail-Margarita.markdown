 There have been several claims to Margarita's origins. But no one really knows who came up with this world famous drink. I was at a bar yesterday whre I was pretty disappointed with the way the drink was presented to me! In its classic form- tequila, lime juice, triple sec, served in a glass with a salted rim is a perfect combination of sweet, salt, sour and bitter. Here is an easy recipe for the real deal.

***Rimming the glass with salt.***

In a cocktail shaker filled with ice, add tequila, triple sec (substitute 3/4th cup of orange juice instead, even though, I suggest on investing on a bottle of triple sec as it is a staple in a lot of cocktails ), lime juice, and sugar. Shake for 30 seconds. Wet the rim of the glass with water or a lime wedge and dip the rim into a plate with salt. Transfer the contents into the salt rimmed glass, garnish with lime and enjoy!

***Here is to a happy gulping!***
