The GulpMag is for all you thirsty blokes but what goes on hence is my own shoutout about discovering probably the most
exciting blogging platform that can be set up free and easily on github. *Enter jekyll , gh-pages and Githib*.
From the bottom of my heart if there is heaven anywhere on earth it is here at Github, Github, Github.

This is our first attempt to host a blog by ourselves for Vgulp. We felt we needed it because we could not really
connect with tumblr on an emotional level. Then came jekyll and github. Boy do i love it! This is just those cases
where you just felt like what the f**k where you doing anything anywhere anyways. I know that we probably have a one
Gig limit on the repository but that goes well and the best part is I know it already. The blog markdown and the
templating is just so bloody fantastic that spinning this up from scratch just tooke me two hours.

#### A blog yes, Git hub static huh ? Then what about Comments? What a S**t brain?

Now not so fast people. With some cool plugins from Disqus we can javascript in the comments baby. Don't believe me?
Just scroll down and weep.Now only Doraemon is cooler. Im just tipping the 4th dimension pocket here.
( I took the code for Disqus from a blog. All credits to the great man. I could not find the link back.
If you ever find him please post a comment. He just saved me a lifetime. If I find it I will include the credits.
Thank you). Ive got this bootstrapped and is supposedly responsive. All this in 2 hours, My dear programming world lemme just go
mad. I owe it to myself.


Thanks also for the folks at Ghost for some inspiration on the themes. Ghost is also another awesome project but had
to rely on a Digital Ocean account for hosting. So leaving that for now. Thanks Universe!
