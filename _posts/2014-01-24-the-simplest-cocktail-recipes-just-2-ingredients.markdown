I love cocktails but don’t exactly enjoy having to stock up on ten different expensive bottles of stuff, just to make one drink. If you know, some of the most famous and delicious cocktails require no greater skill than being able to measure and squeeze the juice out of a lime. So go ahead and grab that shaker and start mixing!
Here are 5 popular, 2 ingredient cocktails that you can make at home.
Base liquor + Mixer = Cocktail!

* **Gin and tonic**
* **Screwdriver**
* **Cape codder**
* **Gimlet**
* **Cuba Libre**

( I will be using 60 ml of liquor as a standard pour for all the drinks. However, you could make it as per your preferred measure. Typically, 45 ml is used as the standard measure for a 2 ingredient cocktail.)

#### Gin and tonic

 The name says it all. In a tall glass with ice, add 60 ml Gin and top it with tonic water. Garnish with a lime wedge.

#### Screwdriver
 You won’t need a screwdriver like how the American engineers literally used one to mix their vodka into cans of orange juice. Just a tall glass with ice, combination of 60 ml vodka, topped with orange juice calls for a taste that is timeless. Use lime or a slice of orange as a garnish.

#### Cape Codder

The name refers to the city of Cape Cod, Eastern Massachusetts, USA, well known for its Cranberry plantations. (Guess where I was last summer soaking up the heat! ). The drink is a combination of 60 ml vodka, topped with cranberry juice and garnished with lime.

#### Cuba Libre
 Cuba Libre meaning ” Free Cuba” is a classic drink with white rum and coke, garnished with a lime wedge. Use Spiced rum or even your favorite Old Monk dark rum for a twist. Do not forget the lime!

#### Gimlet
 Gimlets can be made with either vodka or gin. It’s a combination of a liquor with sweet lime juice served over ice, in a rock’s glass. Garnish with lime. Did you know that the Royal Navy used limes and other citruses to prevent scurvy, (disease resulting from vitamin C deficiency) since the mid 18th century. Yes of course! Their favorite way to ingest was with ALCOHOL!
