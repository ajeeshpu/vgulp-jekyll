Are you still contemplating your Valentine's day ideas and trying to decide how to have a red hot V-day with your sweetheart? There is no need for you to max out your credit card on some fancy dinner or, on a rip- off, lame, pricey cocktail. Pick some food up from your favorite food joint, some scented candles and mix some love this year, at home. I have a perfect recipe for a cocktail that screams love, very fittingly, ***Kamasutra!***

* Ingredients:
* Gin 45 ml
* Sparkling wine (Champagne, Prosecco)
* Strawberry puree 1 Tbsp
* Pineapple juice 30 ml
* Lime and sugar syrup 10 ml each
* Cherry syrup 1 tsp 

Get your partner to lend you a hand on this one.. Puree 5-6 strawberries in a grinder with a tsp of sugar and splashes of water to form a thick paste. While he/she is working on the paste, grab a tall metal tumbler or a cocktail shaker and fill it with ice. Add gin, pineapple juice, juice from half a lime, sugar syrup and cherry syrup (red sugary syrup used to preserve cherries, you can find them at your local grocery store). Add a tbsp of the strawberry puree and shake it for 30 seconds. Transfer the contents into a martini glass (straight up), or a tall glass on the rocks. Top it with sparkling wine. Garnish with love, enjoy!

***Here is to a happy gulping!***
