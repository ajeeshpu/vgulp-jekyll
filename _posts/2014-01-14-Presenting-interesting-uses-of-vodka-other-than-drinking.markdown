 Vodka has a long history of use as medicine apart from being a uniquely intoxicating alcohol! It turns out that it’s a pretty handy stuff to have around. So here we go….

1) ***Give your hair some life*** - Vodka not only makes people lush and bouncy, but can also do the same to your hair. Just add about 30 ml of vodka to your shampoo and you’re all set to walk down the streets pretending like you are in a shampoo commercial.

2) ***Deodorizer*** - Spray vodka into your shoes, clothes let it dry and the stench is gone! Easy peasy.

3) ***Relieve tooth ache*** - Swish a shot of vodka over the affected tooth and see how well it eases the pain. It numbs the gums and you soon won’t feel a thing.

4) ***Stain remover*** - Spray vodka on stains (even on stains from vomit!) . Scrub with a brush and pat it dry. (Or you can take a proactive approach and drink more vodka in the first place so your puke won’t leave stains behind ).

5) ***If all else fails, just turn the bottle up and gulp it down! Nothing will matter anymore, anyway!***
