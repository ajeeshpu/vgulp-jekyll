If you were given an option to be that one person other than yourself, who would you choose to be? Gandhi? Obama? Osama? Well, there is this one personality in my opinion, takes over every other names. I'm a woman, yet, I would love to be James Bond. He, an ageless British super- spy, drank immense amounts of booze and had sex with any woman he desired. You see, 007 has had a huge impact on the culture of the world. Martinis are ordered ***" Shaken not Stirred."*** People introduce themselves with their last names first. The bottom line is, James Bond is the ultimate gentleman with an impeccable taste.

***Martini***

Typically, a martini is made with gin, traditionally, dry vermouth and olives/ lemon twist for garnishing, served straight up in a martini glass. Contrary to the popular belief, any unflavored martini (without fruit juices or other mixers) should be stirred and not shaken. (Ask any mixologist, especially one who specifically calls him a mixologist and not a bartender). To add insult, many purists believe a vodka martini is no martini at all; only gin will do. Now, let me explain to you the "why not" of don't shake a martini.
When you shake a drink with ice, it dilutes the drink. So, you are actually watering down the real deal here. A shaken martini is usually colder than one stirred, since the ice has had a chance to swish around the drink more. Shaking a martini dissolves air into the mix; this is the "bruising" of the gin and seasoned martini drinkers complain about it as being too "sharp."

Now let's get down to James Bond's Vesper Martini.

The Vesper according to Ian Fleming and James Bond: 

"Three measures of Gordon's, one of vodka, half a measure of Kina Lillet. Shake it very well until it's ice-cold, then add a large thin slice of lemon peel. Got it?"
-Casino Royale, Chapter 7

Bond, mixed gin,vodka and Kina lillet was his preferred brand of dry vermouth made in France.

All things said, I would any day trade my life with James Bond 007, and simply bond with only the best except for a shaken martini.
